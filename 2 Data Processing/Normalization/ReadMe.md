# Data Preprocessing: Normalization

Data normalization is a fundamental data preprocessing step in computer vision that involves transforming pixel values in images to a standardized range. In this note, we'll explore the benefits of normalization, its impact on model convergence and stability, and how to implement it using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Benefits of Data Normalization

1. **Standardized Range:** Data normalization scales pixel values to a consistent range, typically [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This standardization ensures that all input features have a similar influence on the model.

2. **Faster Convergence:** Normalized data aids in faster convergence during training, as it prevents extreme values that might slow down gradient-based optimization algorithms.

3. **Model Stability:** Normalization helps the model become more stable by reducing sensitivity to variations in input data, such as lighting conditions.

## Implementing Data Normalization

### Using TensorFlow

In TensorFlow, you can easily normalize image data using operations from the `tf.image` module:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load an image
image = tf.io.read_file("image.jpg")
image = tf.image.decode_image(image)

# Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
normalized_image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, tf.float32)
