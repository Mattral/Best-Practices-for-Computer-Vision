# Handling Imbalanced Data in Computer Vision

Imbalanced datasets are a common challenge in computer vision, where one class significantly outnumbers the others. In this note, we'll discuss the challenges posed by imbalanced data, and we'll explore methods like oversampling, undersampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance. We'll also provide references to Python libraries like imbalanced-learn for implementing these techniques.

## Challenges of Imbalanced Datasets

Working with imbalanced datasets can lead to several challenges in computer vision:

1. **Biased Models:** Models trained on imbalanced data may become biased towards the majority class, making them less capable of recognizing minority class samples.

2. **Low Recall:** Low recall rates for minority classes can lead to missed detections in applications like object detection or medical image analysis.

3. **Overfitting:** Imbalanced datasets can result in models that overfit the majority class, leading to poor generalization.

4. **Unequal Contribution:** Models may give more weight to the majority class, leading to poor decision boundaries.

## Techniques for Handling Imbalanced Data

### 1. Oversampling

Oversampling involves generating additional examples for the minority class to balance class distribution. A common technique is to replicate samples from the minority class.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)

# Resample the dataset
X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X, y)
