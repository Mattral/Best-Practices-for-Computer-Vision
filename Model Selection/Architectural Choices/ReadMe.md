# Architectural Choices in Computer Vision

Selecting the right CNN architecture is essential for achieving optimal results in various computer vision tasks. In this note, we'll provide guidance on choosing the appropriate architecture for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. We'll also highlight the unique characteristics and advantages of specific architectures and provide code examples for popular deep learning frameworks.

## Image Classification

**Task:** Assign a label to an entire image.

**Recommended Architectures:**

- **VGG (e.g., VGG16, VGG19):** Known for its simplicity and strong performance, VGG architectures are reliable choices for image classification tasks. They consist of a stack of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.

- **ResNet (e.g., ResNet50):** ResNet models excel in image classification tasks due to their depth and residual connections. These connections mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and allow training very deep networks.

- **EfficientNet (e.g., EfficientNetB0):** When resource efficiency is crucial, EfficientNet models offer a balance between performance and computational requirements.

**Code Example (TensorFlow/Keras):**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB0

# Load a pretrained model
model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)
# OR
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include top=True)
# OR
model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet', include top=True)
